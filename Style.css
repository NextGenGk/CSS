/* Color Properties */

Text
Whenever an element is rendered, these properties are used to determine the color of the text, its background, and any decorations on the text.

color
The color to use when drawing the text and any text decorations (such as the addition of under- or overlines, strike-through lines, and so forth.

background-color
The text's background color.

text-shadow
Configures a shadow effect to apply to text. Among the options for the shadow is the shadow's base color (which is then blurred and blended with the background based on the other parameters). See Text drop shadows to learn more.

text-decoration-color
By default, text decorations (such as underlines, strikethroughs, etc.) use the color property as their colors. However, you can override that behavior and use a different color for them with the text-decoration-color property.

text-emphasis-color
The color to use when drawing emphasis symbols adjacent to each character in the text. This is used primarily when drawing text for East Asian languages.

caret-color
The color to use when drawing the caret (sometimes referred to as the text input cursor) within the element. This is only useful in elements that are editable, such as <input> and <textarea> or elements whose HTML contenteditable attribute is set.

Boxes
Every element is a box with some sort of content, and has a background and a border in addition to whatever contents the box may have.

Borders
See the section Borders for a list of the CSS properties you can use to set the colors of a box's borders.

background-color
The background color to use in areas of the element that have no foreground content.

column-rule-color
The color to use when drawing the line separating columns of text.

outline-color
The color to use when drawing an outline around the outside of the element. This outline is different from the border in that it doesn't get space set aside for it in the document (so it may overlap other content). It's generally used as a focus indicator, to show which element will receive input events.

Borders
Any element can have a border drawn around it. A basic element border is a line drawn around the edges of the element's content. See The box model to learn about the relationship between elements and their borders, and the article Styling borders using CSS to learn more about applying styles to borders.

You can use the border shorthand property, which lets you configure everything about the border in one shot (including non-color features of borders, such as its width, style (solid, dashed, etc.), and so forth.

border-color
Specifies a single color to use for every side of the element's border.

border-left-color, border-right-color, border-top-color, and border-bottom-color
Lets you set the color of the corresponding side of the element's border.

border-block-start-color and border-block-end-color
With these, you can set the color used to draw the borders which are closest to the start and end of the block the border surrounds. In a left-to-right writing mode (such as the way English is written), the block start border is the top edge and the block end is the bottom. This differs from the inline start and end, which are the left and right edges (corresponding to where each line of text in the box begins and ends).

border-inline-start-color and border-inline-end-color
These let you color the edges of the border closest to the beginning and the end of the start of lines of text within the box. Which side this is will vary depending on the writing-mode, direction, and text-orientation properties, which are typically (but not always) used to adjust text directionality based on the language being displayed. For example, if the box's text is being rendered right-to-left, then the border-inline-start-color is applied to the right side of the border.
